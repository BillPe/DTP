# DTP
Dot the Pigeon (Javascript)

The aim of this project is to get an understanding of Github and to make version changes to Dot the Pigeon.
Dot the Pigeon (DTP) was written many years ago as a Java Applet. Recently I 'found' HTML5/Canvas and crudely converted DTP to Javascript, line by line.  What I aim to do now is re-write the program in Javascript but with the 'OO'.  You can see the game at www.aasvoguelle.co.uk, choose the menu option 'Dot the Pigeon'.
